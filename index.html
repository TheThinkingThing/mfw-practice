        <p>I am 24 years old, from Fresno and I really enjoy every aspect of computers. I started fixing computers at around 14, inspired by watching my Mom fix the computer i had just finished bricking. I have an interest in every aspect of computers, from fixing hardware and software to now coding. I am a novice html css programmer, i've been doing it for about 5 months now. Before that I did some Python for 3 months and during that time I was able to make a couple of simple games which was pretty cool. This was the turning point for me and really pushed me to want to learn code more. I found the first available classes that I could take in Fresno and now here I am 7 weeks in at geekwise.</p>
